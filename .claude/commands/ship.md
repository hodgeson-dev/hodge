## Response Parsing (AI Instructions)

When user responds to choice prompts:
- "a" or "b" etc. → select single option
- "a,b" or "a, b" → select multiple options (comma-separated, if applicable)
- "r" → select all options marked with ⭐ (when 2+ recommendations exist)
- "a, and [modification]" → select option with user's changes applied
- Invalid (e.g., "7" when options are a-d) OR uncertain (e.g., "maybe b?") → use collaborative error recovery:
  - Detect uncertainty patterns: "maybe", "?", "not sure", "either"
  - Offer repair options, never just reject
  - Example: "Hmm, I got 'maybe b?' - sounds uncertain. Let me help clarify: a) Continue with b, b) Explain options better, c) Start over"

## Standards Review Process

### AI Standards Compliance Check
Before shipping, you MUST ensure all standards are met at the **BLOCKING Level**:

- [ ] **All tests passing** (no failures allowed)
- [ ] **No TypeScript errors** (strict mode compliance)
- [ ] **No ESLint errors** (warnings acceptable)
- [ ] **Performance standards met** (CLI < 500ms response)
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (if public APIs changed)
- [ ] **Test coverage >80%** for new code

If any BLOCKING standards are not met, return to `/harden` phase.

📍 Step 1 of 4: Analyze Changes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Remaining:
  ○ Generate Rich Commit Message
  ○ Interactive Approval & Lessons
  ○ Ship Quality Checks & Commit

## Step 1: Analyze Changes
First, analyze the git changes to understand what was modified:

```bash
# Parse feature argument and extract --skip-tests flag if present
raw_feature="{{feature}}"
skip_tests_flag=""
if [[ "$raw_feature" == *"--skip-tests"* ]]; then
    skip_tests_flag="--skip-tests"
    feature="${raw_feature//--skip-tests/}"
    feature="${feature// /}"
else
    feature="$raw_feature"
fi

# Check if feature is ready
if [ ! -d ".hodge/features/$feature/harden" ]; then
    echo "⚠️ Feature has not been hardened yet"
    echo "Run: hodge harden $feature"
    exit 1
fi

# Gather change information
echo "📊 Analyzing changes for $feature..."
git status --short
echo ""
echo "📝 Detailed changes:"
git diff --stat
echo ""
echo "📄 File-by-file changes:"
git diff --name-status
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📍 Step 2 of 4: Generate Rich Commit Message
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Previously completed:
  ✓ Analyze Changes

Remaining:
  ○ Interactive Approval & Lessons
  ○ Ship Quality Checks & Commit

## Step 2: Generate Rich Commit Message

Based on the git analysis above, generate a detailed commit message that:
1. Uses conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:, refactor:, chore:)
2. Provides a clear, concise summary in the first line
3. Includes a "What Changed" section with specific details
4. Explains "Why This Change" when the context is clear
5. Lists the "Impact" of the changes
6. References the issue ID if available

**Analyze the actual changes from the git diff above to create a contextual message.**

For example, if package.json changed, list specific dependencies updated.
If tests were added, mention the test count and what they test.
If it's a bug fix, explain what was broken and how it's fixed.

### Generated Commit Message:
```
[Create a rich, detailed commit message based on the actual git diff analysis above]

## What Changed
- [Specific files and changes, e.g., "Modified 3 ship command files"]
- [Dependencies if package.json changed]
- [Test additions with counts]
- [Documentation updates]

## Why This Change
[Explain the motivation based on the feature name and changes]

## Impact
- [User-facing impacts]
- [Developer experience improvements]
- [Performance or reliability changes]
```

COMMIT MESSAGE FOR REVIEW:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Display the generated message from Step 2]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED

Options:

a) ⭐ Approve - Use this message (Recommended)
r) Regenerate - Create a different message
e) Edit - Let me modify this message
c) Cancel - Stop the ship process

💡 Tip: You can modify any choice, e.g., "a, and add a breaking change note"

👉 Your choice [a/r/e/c]:
```

### Based on User Choice:

**If (a) Approve:**
Save the message to the interaction state and proceed with shipping.

Use the Write tool to save the approved message to both ui.md AND state.json (Write tool creates parent directories automatically):

**Write to:** `.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/{{feature}}/ui.md`
```markdown
# Ship Commit - {{feature}}

## Approved Commit Message

```
[The approved commit message]
```
```

**Write to:** `.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/{{feature}}/state.json`
```json
{
  "command": "ship",
  "feature": "{{feature}}",
  "status": "edited",
  "timestamp": "{{current_iso_timestamp}}",
  "environment": "Claude Code",
  "data": {
    "edited": "[The approved commit message]",
    "suggested": "[Original suggested message if available]"
  },
  "history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "{{current_iso_timestamp}}",
      "type": "edit",
      "data": "User approved message via slash command"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**: Replace `{{feature}}` and `{{current_iso_timestamp}}` with actual values, and insert the actual approved commit message in the appropriate locations.

Finally, run ship with the message (it will detect and use the edited state):
```bash
hodge ship "$feature" $skip_tests_flag
```

**If (r) Regenerate:**
Return to Step 2 and create a different version of the commit message, varying:
- The phrasing and structure
- The level of detail
- The emphasis on different aspects

**If (e) Edit:**
Ask the user to provide their edited version:
```
Please provide your edited commit message:
(Paste the complete message below)
```

Then use the Write tool to save their edited version to state files (Write tool creates parent directories automatically):

**Write to:** `.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/{{feature}}/ui.md`
```markdown
# Ship Commit - {{feature}}

## Edited Commit Message

```
[User's edited commit message]
```
```

**Write to:** `.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/{{feature}}/state.json`
```json
{
  "command": "ship",
  "feature": "{{feature}}",
  "status": "edited",
  "timestamp": "{{current_iso_timestamp}}",
  "environment": "Claude Code",
  "data": {
    "edited": "[User's edited commit message]",
    "suggested": "[Original suggested message]"
  },
  "history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "{{current_iso_timestamp}}",
      "type": "edit",
      "data": "User provided custom message via slash command"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**: Replace `{{feature}}` and `{{current_iso_timestamp}}` with actual values, and insert the user's actual edited commit message.

Finally, run ship with the edited message:
```bash
hodge ship "$feature" $skip_tests_flag
```

**If (c) Cancel:**
```bash
echo "Ship cancelled. Your changes remain uncommitted."
echo "Run '/ship {{feature}}' when ready to try again."
```

## Step 3.5: Capture Lessons Learned (Optional - Before Commit)

**IMPORTANT**: This step happens BEFORE the ship command executes, so lessons are included in the feature commit.

### Ask User About Lessons

```
Would you like to document lessons learned from this feature? (y/n)

This will be committed with your feature work.
```

If user says **no** or **n**:
- Thank them and skip to Step 4
- No lesson files will be created
- Proceed directly to ship execution

If user says **yes** or **y**, proceed with enhancement questions:

### Gather Lessons Information

Ask the following questions to gather insights (3-4 questions):

**Question 1: What Worked Well**
```
What approach or technique worked particularly well in this implementation?

(Share your thoughts, or type 'skip' to skip this question)
```

**Question 2: What to Improve**
```
If you were implementing this feature again, what would you do differently?

(Share your thoughts, or type 'skip' to skip this question)
```

**Question 3: Gotchas and Surprises**
```
Were there any gotchas, surprises, or unexpected challenges?

(Share your thoughts, or type 'skip' to skip this question)
```

**Question 4: Pattern Potential** (Optional)
```
Did you create reusable code that could become a pattern for others?

(Share your thoughts, or type 'skip' to skip this question)
```

### Analyze and Create Finalized Lesson

After gathering responses, create the enriched lesson:

1. **Read context files**:
   ```bash
   # Get git diff to analyze changes
   git diff --stat
   git diff --name-status

   # Review exploration decisions
   cat ".hodge/features/$feature/explore/exploration.md"

   # Check decisions made
   cat ".hodge/features/$feature/decisions.md" 2>/dev/null || grep -A 10 "Feature: $feature" .hodge/decisions.md
   ```

2. **Generate enriched lesson** combining:
   - Git diff analysis (files changed, scope of changes)
   - User insights from questions above
   - Exploration context and decisions made
   - Lessons structure similar to `HODGE-003-feature-extraction.md`

3. **Create finalized lesson**:

   First, generate descriptive slug from feature title:
   ```bash
   slug=$(echo "{{feature}}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/hodge-//' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g')
   echo "Lesson file will be: .hodge/lessons/{{feature}}-${slug}.md"
   ```

   Then use the Write tool to create the enriched lesson (Write tool creates parent directories automatically):

   **Write to:** `.hodge/lessons/{{feature}}-{{slug}}.md`
   ```markdown
# Lessons Learned: {{feature}}

## Feature: [Feature Title]

### The Problem
[Describe the problem this feature solved]

### Approach Taken
[Summarize the implementation approach chosen]

### Key Learnings

#### 1. [Learning Title]
**Discovery**: [What was discovered]

**Solution**: [How it was addressed]

[User insights from questions]

### Code Examples
[Include relevant code patterns if applicable]

### Impact
[Describe the impact and benefits]

### Related Decisions
[List related decisions from decisions.md]

---
_Documented: {{current_date}}_
```

   **Important**: Replace `{{feature}}`, `{{slug}}`, and `{{current_date}}` with actual values, and fill in all bracketed sections with the enriched content.

   Then confirm to the user:
   ```bash
   echo "✅ Lessons documented at: .hodge/lessons/{{feature}}-${slug}.md"
   echo "This will be committed with your feature."
   ```

4. **Example Enriched Lesson Structure**:

   See `.hodge/lessons/HODGE-003-feature-extraction.md` for example of rich lesson format with:
   - Problem statement and context
   - Approach evolution (what worked, what didn't)
   - Key learnings with code examples
   - Impact assessment
   - Related decisions

### Elevation Analysis (After Lesson Creation)

After creating the lesson, analyze whether any insights should be elevated to project-level artifacts:

**Ask yourself (AI):**
1. **Is this an architectural principle?** → Should it be a STANDARD?
   - Does it define fundamental system architecture?
   - Would violating it break the architecture?
   - Should it be enforced at all phases?
   - Examples: CLI/AI separation, non-interactive commands, test isolation

2. **Is this a reusable implementation?** → Should it be a PATTERN?
   - Is it a proven solution to a recurring problem?
   - Can it be applied in multiple contexts?
   - Does it have clear usage guidelines?
   - Examples: async resource pattern, error context pattern

3. **Is this a project-wide decision?** → Should it be a DECISION?
   - Does it constrain future feature development?
   - Should all developers know about it?
   - Is it a trade-off or architectural choice?
   - Examples: "Use pino for logging", "Prefer integration tests"

4. **Is this a philosophical guideline?** → Should it be a PRINCIPLE?
   - Does it guide thinking and approach?
   - Is it aspirational rather than enforceable?
   - Does it shape the project's character?
   - Examples: "Freedom to explore, discipline to ship"

**Present Recommendation to User:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 LESSON ELEVATION ANALYSIS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I've analyzed the lesson and identified the following recommendation:

[Recommendation Type]: STANDARD | PATTERN | DECISION | PRINCIPLE | NONE

**What to Elevate**:
[Specific insight from the lesson]

**Why**:
[Reasoning - why this should be elevated]

**Where**:
[Target file - .hodge/standards.md, .hodge/patterns/, .hodge/decisions.md, .hodge/principles.md]

**Proposed Addition**:
[Show the exact text that would be added]

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED

Would you like to:

a) ⭐ Approve - Add this to {{target_file}} (Recommended)
b) Modify - Let me adjust the recommendation
c) Skip - Keep it as a lesson only
d) Discuss - I have questions or want to explore this more

💡 Tip: You can modify any choice, e.g., "a, and also add it to the project README"

👉 Your choice [a/b/c/d]:
```

**Based on User Choice:**

**If (a) Approve:**
- Use Edit or Write tool to add the content to the appropriate file
- Commit the change immediately (separate commit from feature)
- Confirm: "✅ Elevated to {{type}} in {{file}}"

**If (b) Modify:**
- Ask: "What would you like to change about the recommendation?"
- Iterate on the proposed text
- Present again for approval

**If (c) Skip:**
- Confirm: "Keeping as lesson only. You can elevate it later if needed."
- Proceed to ship

**If (d) Discuss:**
- Engage in conversation about the recommendation
- Answer questions, explore alternatives
- Eventually circle back to approve/modify/skip

**Important Notes**:
- Not every lesson needs elevation - most are feature-specific insights
- Elevation should happen when the insight has **project-wide applicability**
- Standards are mandatory (enforced), patterns are guidance (suggested)
- Multiple elevations possible (e.g., both a standard AND a pattern)

📍 Step 4 of 4: Ship Quality Checks & Commit
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Previously completed:
  ✓ Analyze Changes
  ✓ Generate Rich Commit Message
  ✓ Interactive Approval & Lessons

## Step 4: Ship Quality Checks & Commit

The ship command will run all quality checks and generate a detailed report. **You must review this report before the feature is committed.**

After running `hodge ship "{{feature}}"`, the CLI will:
- ✅ Run all tests
- ✅ Run linting checks
- ✅ Run type checking
- ✅ Generate quality-checks.md with full tool output
- ✅ Verify all quality gates pass
- ✅ Stage all files (including lessons if created) with `git add -A`
- ✅ Create git commit with approved message
- ✅ Update PM tracking
- ✅ Learn patterns from shipped code

### Review Quality Check Results

**After the ship command completes**, read the quality check results to verify all issues are resolved:

```bash
# Read ship validation results
cat .hodge/features/{{feature}}/ship/validation-results.json
```

This contains structured results from all quality checks run during ship. Review it to ensure:
- **No test failures** - All tests must pass (errorCount = 0 for test tools)
- **No TypeScript errors** - Type checking must be clean (errorCount = 0 for typescript)
- **No ESLint errors** - Errors must be fixed (errorCount = 0, warningCount acceptable)
- **No security issues** - Security scanner must pass
- **No critical architecture violations** - Circular dependencies and major issues resolved

**Question**: Did you find any ERRORS (not warnings) in the validation-results.json?

#### If YES (Errors Found) → ABORT SHIP 🚫

The ship command should have prevented commit if there were errors, but if you see any:

```
🚫 SHIP ABORTED - Blocking Issues Found

There are errors that must be fixed before shipping:

[List the specific errors from validation-results.json]

### Next Steps:
• Fix the errors listed above
• Re-run `/harden {{feature}}` to verify fixes
• Re-run `/ship {{feature}}` when ready
```

#### If NO (No Errors) → CONTINUE ✅

Great! All quality gates passed. The feature has been shipped successfully

## Troubleshooting
- **Tests failing?** Fix them first with `/build {{feature}}`
- **Not hardened?** Run `/harden {{feature}}` first
- **Need to skip quality gates?** Use `/ship {{feature}} --skip-tests`
  - Quality checks will still run but won't block the commit
  - Use for: emergency hotfixes, WIP state preservation, broken test infrastructure
  - Not recommended for regular workflow - prefer fixing issues first
