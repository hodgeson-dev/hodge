# Hodge Decide - Decision Management

## ⚠️ DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: Interactive Decision Mode

**IMPORTANT**: Unless the user explicitly provides a pre-made decision, ALWAYS use Interactive Decision Mode (see below). Do NOT jump directly to recording a decision without presenting options first.

### ❌ WRONG: Jumping to recording
```
User: /decide
AI: *immediately executes hodge decide "Some decision"*
```

### ✅ RIGHT: Present options first
```
User: /decide
AI: *presents decision options with pros/cons*
User: chooses option 'a'
AI: *then executes hodge decide with chosen option*
```

## Interactive Decision Mode (DEFAULT)
When `/decide` is invoked, follow this process:

1. **Review Guiding Principles**:
   ```bash
   cat .hodge/principles.md | head -20
   ```
   Consider how principles might guide the decision.

2. **Gather pending decisions using Decision Categories Framework**:

   **PRIMARY SOURCE - Current Exploration**:
   ```bash
   # Check for decisions documented during exploration
   cat .hodge/features/{{current_feature}}/explore/exploration.md | grep -A 5 "Decisions Needed"
   ```

   **SECONDARY SOURCES - Always check these categories**:
   - **Implementation Approach**: Which approach from exploration to use?
   - **Scope Decisions**: What's in/out of scope for this feature?
   - **Technical Choices**: Libraries, patterns, architecture decisions
   - **Naming Conventions**: Feature names, function names, file structure
   - **Testing Strategy**: What and how to test?
   - **TODO Resolution**: Which TODOs to address now vs later?

   **TERTIARY SOURCES**:
   - Code comments (TODO, FIXME, QUESTION) - `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/`
   - Uncommitted changes - `git status --short`
   - Open questions in conversation

   **IMPORTANT**: Try to find at least 2-3 decisions. If fewer exist, that's okay, but always check all categories.

3. **Present each decision with Principle Alignment**:
   ```
   ## Decision {{number}} of {{total}}

   **Topic**: {{decision_topic}}
   **Context**: {{brief_context}}

   **Principle Consideration**:
   [Note if decision aligns with or conflicts with any principles]

   **Options:**

   **a) {{option_1}}** (Recommended)
      - Pros: {{pros}}
      - Cons: {{cons}}
      - Alignment: [Aligns with "Progressive Enhancement" principle]

   **b) {{option_2}}**
      - Pros: {{pros}}
      - Cons: {{cons}}
      - Alignment: [May conflict with "Behavior-Focused Testing"]

   **c) {{option_3}}** (if applicable)
      - Pros: {{pros}}
      - Cons: {{cons}}
      - Alignment: [Describe alignment]

   **d) Skip for now**
   **e) Need more exploration**

   Your choice:
   ```

   **REQUIREMENT**: Always mark one option as "(Recommended)" based on your analysis.

4. **For each decision made**:
   ```bash
   hodge decide "{{chosen_option_description}}" --feature {{feature}}
   ```

## Recording the Decision (ONLY after user chooses)

### For Single Decision
After the user has chosen an option (a, b, c, etc.), execute:
```bash
hodge decide "{{decision}}"
```

With feature association:
```bash
hodge decide "{{decision}}" --feature {{feature}}
```

**WARNING**: Never execute this command until the user has explicitly chosen from presented options.

## Decision Format
Decisions follow a structured format with date, status, context, rationale, and consequences.

## Decision Storage
Decisions are stored in `.hodge/decisions.md` and synchronized with the current feature context.

## Work Planning
After making decisions, use the `/plan` command to:
- Break work into epics and stories
- Analyze dependencies
- Allocate work to parallel development lanes
- Create PM tool structure

See `/plan` for detailed work organization capabilities.

## Next Steps
After decisions are recorded:
```
### Next Steps
Choose your next action:
a) Plan work structure → `/plan {{feature}}`
b) Start building → `/build {{feature}}`
c) Review all decisions → `/status`
d) View project roadmap → `hodge status`
e) Continue development
f) Done for now

Enter your choice (a-f):
```

Remember: The `/decide` command focuses purely on recording technical and architectural decisions. Use `/plan` to organize work into epics, stories, and development lanes.
