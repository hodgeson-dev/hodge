  "commitMessage": "refactor(cli): remove unused commands and options\n\n## What Changed\n- Removed 2 complete commands: `todos` and `link`\n- Deleted 3 files: src/commands/todos.ts (34 lines), src/commands/link.ts (40 lines), src/lib/todo-checker.ts (173 lines)\n- Removed 9 unused CLI options across internal commands:\n  - explore: --force, --from-spec, --pre-populate, --decisions\n  - harden: --auto-fix\n  - context: --list, --recent, --todos\n- Removed orphaned methods from ExploreService: handleFromSpec(), handlePrePopulate()\n- Removed orphaned ContextCommand methods: listSaves(), loadRecentSave(), countTodos()\n- Added comprehensive smoke tests in hodge-371-cleanup.smoke.test.ts (68 lines, 7 tests)\n- Updated src/bin/hodge.ts: removed 59 lines of command/option definitions\n- Updated src/commands/context.ts: removed 171 lines of unused functionality\n- Refactored src/commands/explore.ts: simplified option handling (109 lines modified)\n- Modified 26 files: 1,469 insertions, 677 deletions (net +792 lines including feature docs)\n\n## Why This Change\nFollowing the pattern established in HODGE-369 (ship command cleanup), this comprehensive audit removes commands and options that are never called by slash commands in `.claude/commands/`. This reduces CLI complexity, improves maintainability, and ensures the CLI surface area matches actual usage patterns.\n\nThe cleanup was driven by:\n- Commands `todos` and `link` were never integrated into any slash command workflows\n- Options like `--from-spec`, `--pre-populate`, `--decisions` were explicitly marked as \"(legacy)\" in code\n- Other options like `--force`, `--auto-fix`, `--list`, `--recent`, `--todos` had zero usage in slash commands\n- Grep analysis of `.claude/commands/` confirmed non-usage of all removed features\n\n## Impact\n- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated 247 lines of unused command/implementation code (todos.ts + link.ts + todo-checker.ts)\n- **Cleaner CLI**: 9 fewer options across 3 commands, simpler command signatures\n- **Better Maintainability**: Removed orphaned methods and legacy code paths\n- **No Breaking Changes**: Only removed features never called by slash commands\n- **Maintained Quality**: All 1,357 tests passing, zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint errors\n- **Comprehensive Testing**: 7 new smoke tests verify proper cleanup\n- **Combined Impact**: With HODGE-369, removed 1,981 total lines of unused code from codebase\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
