  "commitMessage": "refactor(architecture): fix graph generation by using toolchain config\n\n## What Changed\n- Added graph_command configuration to dependency-cruiser in .hodge/toolchain.yaml\n- Refactored ArchitectureGraphService to read from toolchain config instead of tool registry\n- Removed findGraphTool() method (35 lines) - no longer needed\n- Changed to read tool name from analysisConfig.architecture_graph.tool\n- Changed to read graph_command from toolchainConfig.commands[tool].graph_command\n- Improved command security validation to distinguish safe patterns (||, &&) from unsafe ones\n- Extracted validateToolConfig() helper method to reduce cognitive complexity\n- Removed unused imports (yaml, ToolRegistry) from ship.ts\n- Updated tests to match new behavior (removed toolRegistry parameter, fixed error messages)\n- Modified 4 files: 74 insertions, 86 deletions (net -12 lines)\n\n## Why This Change\nThe architecture graph generation was broken because it tried to find tools in the tool registry, but dependency-cruiser doesn't exist there. The tool registry pattern doesn't work for architecture graphing since it's tool-specific configuration that belongs in toolchain.yaml.\n\nThis refactoring fixes the issue by:\n1. Making graph_command explicitly configurable in toolchain.yaml (like other tool commands)\n2. Reading the configured tool name from the analysis config\n3. Reading the graph_command from the toolchain commands section\n4. Eliminating the dependency on tool registry for architecture graphing\n\nThe security validation was also improved to properly allow boolean operators (|| for error handling, && for chaining) while still blocking actual injection vectors.\n\n## Impact\n- **Fixed Functionality**: Architecture graph generation now works correctly\n- **Better Architecture**: Configuration lives in the right place (toolchain.yaml, not tool registry)\n- **Cleaner Code**: Removed 35 lines of unnecessary findGraphTool() logic, reduced cognitive complexity\n- **Improved Security**: More precise validation distinguishes safe vs unsafe shell patterns\n- **Consistent Pattern**: Follows same pattern as other toolchain commands\n- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing toolchain.yaml configurations continue to work\n- **All Tests Passing**: 1,357 tests pass, zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint errors\n\n## Technical Details\nThe root cause was architectural - trying to use tool-registry.yaml (which defines cross-project tool capabilities) for project-specific command configuration. Architecture graph commands are inherently project-specific (different paths, different options per project) and belong in toolchain.yaml.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
