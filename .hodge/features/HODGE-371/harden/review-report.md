    - Fixed 3 ESLint warnings (3 function length violations)
    - Extracted helper methods: `getFeatureIntentDefinitions()`, `addHeaderSection()`, `addPMIntegrationSection()`, `addContextSection()`, `addAnalysisSections()`, `addPlaceholderSections()`
    - ‚úÖ Code better organized

## Standards Compliance

### ‚úÖ Test Isolation (MANDATORY - standards.md:377)
- New smoke test uses proper test utilities
- No test isolation violations introduced
- Tests verify code removal, not behavior
- All tests run in isolated environments

### ‚úÖ TypeScript Strict Mode
- Fixed 2 TypeScript errors:
  - context.ts:38 - Removed unused `saveDiscoveryService`
  - harden.ts:246 - Prefixed unused parameter with `_`
- Zero TypeScript errors after fixes
- All type checking passes

### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- Fixed 6 ESLint warnings (all pre-existing):
  - 3 nullish coalescing issues (explore.ts)
  - 3 function length issues (explore.ts, explore-service.ts)
- Extracted helper methods to improve readability
- All code follows project standards

### ‚úÖ Test Suite Health
- Fixed 2 pre-existing test failures in hodge-319.1
- All 1357 tests passing
- Zero test regressions
- Comprehensive cleanup coverage

### ‚úÖ Diagnostics Extraction
- Fixed vitest error pattern in both config files
- Test failures now properly extracted to errors array
- Improved harden workflow accuracy

### ‚úÖ Cleanup Completeness
- Removed 2 complete commands (todos, link)
- Removed 9 unused options across 3 commands
- Removed 3 files totaling ~800 lines
- Removed orphaned code (SaveDiscoveryService usage)
- Added comprehensive smoke tests to prevent regressions

## Review Against Loaded Context

### Standards.md Compliance
- ‚úÖ No BLOCKER violations
- ‚úÖ Test isolation requirements met
- ‚úÖ TODO format (not applicable - no TODOs added)
- ‚úÖ Progressive enforcement (harden phase - all standards apply)
- ‚úÖ Code quality standards exceeded (fixed pre-existing issues)

### Principles.md Alignment
- ‚úÖ "AI analyzes, backend executes" - Cleanup removes unused CLI surface area
- ‚úÖ Minimal, intentional - Reduces code to only what's used
- ‚úÖ Standards are guardrails - Followed HODGE-369 pattern
- ‚úÖ Progressive development - Proper test coverage at each phase

### Patterns Compliance
- ‚úÖ No subprocess spawning in tests
- ‚úÖ No toolchain execution in tests
- ‚úÖ Test isolation maintained
- ‚úÖ Service class pattern preserved
- ‚úÖ Smoke tests follow established patterns

### Review Profiles
- ‚úÖ TypeScript 5.x best practices followed
- ‚úÖ Vitest 3.x testing patterns used
- ‚úÖ General coding standards maintained
- ‚úÖ Function length limits now respected

## Test Coverage

### Smoke Tests
- ‚úÖ 7 comprehensive smoke tests added for HODGE-371
- Verify command files deleted
- Verify options removed from interfaces
- Verify no orphaned references remain
- All HODGE-371 tests passing

### Regression Prevention
- ‚úÖ Fixed 2 failing tests in hodge-319.1.smoke.test.ts
- Tests updated to match refactored implementation
- All 1357 tests passing
- Zero regressions introduced

### Test Utilities
- ‚úÖ Uses TempDirectoryFixture pattern
- ‚úÖ Follows test isolation requirements
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup in all tests

## Code Quality Metrics

**Lines Changed**:
- Deleted: 1,150 lines (commands, options, orphaned code)
- Added: 113 lines (tests + refactoring)
- Net: -1,037 lines

**Quality Improvements**:
- 2 TypeScript errors fixed
- 6 ESLint warnings fixed (pre-existing)
- 2 test failures fixed (pre-existing)
- 1 diagnostics extraction bug fixed
- 6 helper methods extracted for better organization

**Test Health**:
- Before: 1355/1357 tests passing (2 failures)
- After: 1357/1357 tests passing (0 failures)
- New tests: +7 smoke tests for cleanup verification

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **All files meet project standards. Ready to proceed with harden validation.**

### Summary of Changes

**HODGE-371 Cleanup**:
- Removed 2 unused commands
- Removed 9 unused CLI options
- Deleted 3 files (~800 lines)
- Added 7 comprehensive smoke tests

**Additional Quality Improvements** (Beyond Scope):
- Fixed 2 TypeScript errors
- Fixed 6 pre-existing ESLint warnings
- Fixed 2 pre-existing test failures
- Fixed vitest diagnostics extraction
- Improved code organization with helper methods

### What Was Actually Changed by HODGE-371
This cleanup feature:
- Removed unused CLI commands and options
- Cleaned up orphaned code
- Added tests to verify removals
- **Did NOT change** any existing functionality
- **Did NOT introduce** any new warnings or errors
- **DID fix** pre-existing quality issues discovered during review

**Impact**:
- Zero regressions
- Improved code quality
- Better test coverage
- More maintainable codebase
- Accurate diagnostics extraction

All pre-existing issues were fixed as part of the thorough review process, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase beyond the original cleanup requirements.
