  "commitMessage": "refactor(context): remove session fallback magic and consolidate session management\n\n## What Changed\n- Removed session fallback from /hodge command (context.ts:90)\n- Consolidated SessionManager into ContextManager as single source of truth\n- Deleted src/lib/session-manager.ts and associated tests (200+ lines removed)\n- Updated 4 files to use ContextManager: explore-service.ts, context.ts, status.ts, hodge-md-context-gatherer.ts\n- Removed unused session fields: recentCommands, recentDecisions, summary, nextAction\n- Updated HODGE.md generation to use WorkflowContext from context.json\n- Modified 7 files with 138 insertions, 31 deletions\n\n## Why This Change\nThe /hodge command was unexpectedly loading feature context when no feature was specified, due to session-aware fallback behavior (const feature = featureArg ?? session?.feature). This \"magic\" behavior confused users who expected to load only global context when starting new work.\n\nAdditionally, the codebase maintained two separate session management systems (SessionManager reading .hodge/.session and ContextManager reading .hodge/context.json) that duplicated responsibility and created maintenance overhead. Both tracked feature and mode, creating confusion about the source of truth.\n\nThis change makes feature loading explicit and predictable:\n1. /hodge (no args) → loads global context only\n2. /explore \"description\" → creates feature, updates context.json\n3. /build (no args) → reads feature from context.json\n4. /hodge HODGE-XXX → explicitly loads that feature's context\n\n## Impact\n- Eliminates confusion about session state - context.json is now the single source of truth\n- Simplifies codebase by removing ~200 lines of duplicate session management code\n- Makes feature loading explicit rather than magical\n- Improves predictability of /hodge command behavior\n- Reduces maintenance burden by eliminating dual session systems\n- Aligns with CLI Architecture Standard: commands should be explicit, not magical\n\nTest Results:\n- All 1364 tests passing\n- Zero TypeScript errors\n- Zero ESLint errors  \n- Duplication: 0.34% (acceptable)\n- 14 acceptable warnings (TODOs, function length)\n- 1 architectural warning (claude-commands.ts orphan - known issue)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
