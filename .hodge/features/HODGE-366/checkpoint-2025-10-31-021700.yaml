phase: harden
featureId: HODGE-366
summary: "ESLint rule added, ExploreCommand fixed, ShipCommand partially fixed but blocked by contextManager singleton"

progress:
  - "Added ESLint rule to block process.chdir() in test files"
  - "Fixed all ExploreCommand test isolation violations (8 test files)"
  - "Removed test files from .eslintignore"
  - "Added basePath parameter to ShipCommand constructor"
  - "Fixed ship.ts to use this.basePath instead of process.cwd()"

decisions:
  - "Use local ESLint rule (no-process-chdir-in-tests) to enforce test isolation"
  - "Apply test isolation fix progressively across commands"
  - "ExploreCommand complete, ShipCommand blocked by architectural issue"

blockers:
  - "ShipCommand uses contextManager singleton which initializes with process.cwd() at module load"
  - "Fixing ShipCommand properly requires making ContextManager non-singleton (beyond HODGE-366 scope)"
  - "5 ship.integration.test.ts tests failing - need different approach"

nextSteps:
  - "DECISION POINT: Strip unused ship options/tests OR add ESLint exception for ship tests"
  - "Option A: Remove unused ship functionality + tests, fix remaining core tests"
  - "Option B: Add ESLint exception for ship.integration.test.ts with TODO(HODGE-367)"
  - "Complete harden validation for ExploreCommand scope"
  - "Ship HODGE-366 with ExploreCommand complete, ShipCommand as follow-up"

  architecturalIssue: |
    contextManager is a singleton imported at module level with process.cwd().
    Proper fix requires:
    1. Make ContextManager non-singleton
    2. Pass ContextManager instance to all commands
    3. This affects ALL commands (explore, build, decide, harden, ship, status)
    4. Way beyond HODGE-366 scope (which was focused on ExploreCommand)

  conversationHighlights: |
    User correctly identified that stripping unused ship functionality might simplify the problem.
    Context at 88% (176k/200k tokens) - need to wrap up efficiently.
    Core HODGE-366 goal (ExploreCommand test isolation) is COMPLETE and working.
    ShipCommand is additional scope that hit architectural limits.
