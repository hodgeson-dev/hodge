summary: 'Constructor injection pattern implemented, but scope expanded - more services need basePath'

progress:
  - 'Created test-isolation.smoke.test.ts - proves contamination problem (3/3 passing)'
  - 'Modified ExploreCommand to accept basePath parameter (3rd param for backward compatibility)'
  - 'Propagated basePath to 4 services: IDManager, ExploreService, PMHooks, SubFeatureContextService'
  - 'Partially fixed explore.new-style.test.ts (removed process.chdir calls)'
  - 'Established constructor injection pattern for test isolation'

decisions:
  - 'Use minimal surgical approach vs comprehensive 30+ file rewrite'
  - 'Place basePath as 3rd constructor parameter to maintain backward compatibility'
  - 'Services cascade basePath through their dependencies'
  - 'Discovered scope is larger than initial exploration estimated'

blockers:
  - 'Tests still contaminate project directory - more services need basePath'
  - 'PatternLearner uses hardcoded relative path .hodge/patterns'
  - 'CacheManager (cacheManager, standardsCache) likely uses process.cwd()'
  - 'Python script to fix test files broke syntax (try/finally removal too aggressive)'
  - '2 of 3 smoke tests in explore.new-style.test.ts still failing'

nextSteps:
  - 'Audit ALL services instantiated in ExploreCommand for process.cwd() usage'
  - 'Add basePath to PatternLearner constructor'
  - 'Check if CacheManager needs basePath parameter'
  - 'Manually fix explore.new-style.test.ts (avoid automated sed/python approaches)'
  - 'Complete remaining 5 test files: id-manager.test.ts, pm-integration.smoke.test.ts, explore.sub-feature.test.ts, explore-timing-fix.integration.test.ts, ship.integration.test.ts'
  - 'Add ESLint rule: no process.chdir() in test files'
  - 'Update standards.md with basePath parameter pattern documentation'

  conversationHighlights: |
    Deep dive revealed the dependency chain is more complex than exploration estimated.
    The "several layers deep" problem manifests as utility services (caches, pattern learners)
    that aren't directly passed to commands but get instantiated with process.cwd() defaults.

    Original exploration plan was sound (constructor injection) but underestimated the number
    of services in the chain. This is a good lesson about progressive discovery - sometimes
    you don't know the full scope until you start implementing.

    Recommended approach: Complete the service cascade systematically rather than trying
    shortcuts like sed/python scripts which proved fragile.
