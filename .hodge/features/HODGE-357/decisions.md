### 2025-10-26 - HODGE-357: Adopt Hybrid Phased + Service Extraction approach for ESLint cleanup

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Feature: HODGE-357

**Decision**:
HODGE-357: Adopt Hybrid Phased + Service Extraction approach for ESLint cleanup. Phase 1 (2 days): Extract ship.ts, toolchain-generator.ts, cache-manager.ts into service methods to reduce complexity 56/40/32â†’<15. Phase 2 (3 days): Refactor 5 high-complexity functions (25-31). Phase 3 (2 days): Fix security vulnerabilities and split oversized files. Phase 4 (1 day): Automated cleanup with eslint --fix. Total: 8 days (~1.5 weeks). Ship incrementally after each phase. Rationale: Balances manageable scope with incremental value delivery, reduces merge conflict risk, allows pause/resume between phases. Alternative Big Bang approach (2-3 weeks) rejected due to high risk and lack of incremental shipping.

**Rationale**:
Recorded via `hodge decide` command at 3:15:23 PM

**Consequences**:
To be determined based on implementation.
