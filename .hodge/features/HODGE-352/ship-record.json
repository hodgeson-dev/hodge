  "commitMessage": "chore(cleanup): project cleanup and professional OSS organization\n\n## What Changed\n- **Deleted outdated artifacts**: Removed podge/ directory (5 old design files), tests/ (empty), file (empty), IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md\n- **Deleted old documentation**: Removed 5 outdated docs/ files (HOD-11-implementation-report.md, PM_INTEGRATION.md, STANDARDS.md, epic-story-breakdown.md, local-testing.md, pre-push-hooks.md)\n- **Rebranded package**: Changed from @agile-explorations/hodge to @hodgeson/hodge in package.json\n- **Updated repository**: Changed GitHub org to hodgeson-dev/hodge, set homepage to www.hodgeson.dev\n- **Added professional OSS files**: \n  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1)\n  - SECURITY.md (vulnerability reporting policy)\n- **Created new documentation structure**:\n  - docs/getting-started.md (installation and first feature guide)\n  - docs/basic-usage.md (common workflows and slash commands)\n  - docs/advanced/README.md (placeholder for advanced topics)\n  - examples/README.md (placeholder for sample projects)\n  - scripts/README.md (documents all 22 scripts)\n- **Updated README.md**: Professional structure with badges (build status, npm version, license)\n- **Updated .gitignore**: Added .hodge/review-profiles/ and report/ patterns\n- **Updated .eslintignore**: Added *.md and *.json exclusions to prevent false positives\n- **Fixed pre-existing test failures**: Corrected build.md template (removed duplicate bell icon from HODGE-346.2)\n- **Updated CHANGELOG.md**: Documented rebranding and cleanup\n- **Updated CONTRIBUTING.md**: Changed repository references to new org\n- **Added comprehensive smoke tests**: 10 tests in src/test/hodge-352.smoke.test.ts verifying cleanup requirements\n\n## Why This Change\nThe project contained several outdated directories, duplicate structures, and missing professional OSS elements that made it feel less polished than it should be for public release.
