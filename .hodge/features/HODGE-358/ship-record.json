  "commitMessage": "feat(checkpoint): add /checkpoint command for conversation state preservation\n\n## What Changed\n- Added `.claude/commands/checkpoint.md` (422 lines) - comprehensive slash command template\n- Modified `src/commands/context.ts` to discover and display checkpoint files\n  - Added `discoverCheckpoints()` method with glob pattern matching and sorting\n  - Integrated checkpoint discovery into `loadFeatureContext()` workflow\n- Created `src/commands/checkpoint.smoke.test.ts` with 5 test cases\n- Fixed semgrep certificate warning in `.hodge/toolchain.yaml` (Boy Scout Rule)\n- Fixed 10 pre-existing nullish coalescing warnings in `src/commands/context.ts` (Boy Scout Rule)\n- Added nullish coalescing operator standard to `.hodge/standards.md` for token efficiency\n\n## Why This Change\nThe `/checkpoint` command formalizes conversation state preservation across `/clear` operations. Previously, context was lost when clearing conversations, forcing users to manually recreate state. The checkpoint command uses YAML format for token-efficient state capture and restoration.\n\nThe nullish coalescing standard addition prevents future ESLint warning cycles by ensuring AI writes code correctly from the start, rather than fixing violations post-hoc.\n\n## Impact\n- Users can preserve conversation state across `/clear` operations\n- Token-efficient YAML format reduces context overhead\n- Checkpoint files are automatically discovered and displayed when loading feature context\n- Future code will use `??` instead of `||` proactively, avoiding fix cycles\n- Cleaner codebase with semgrep warning eliminated and nullish coalescing violations fixed\n\n## Testing\n- All 5 smoke tests passing for checkpoint discovery functionality\n- 131 test files, 1334 tests passing (100% pass rate)\n- No ESLint errors, only pre-existing warnings in unrelated files"
