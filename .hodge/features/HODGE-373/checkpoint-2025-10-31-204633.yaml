phase: build
featureId: HODGE-373
summary: 'Fixed explore.md - applied pattern to BOTH boxes after user testing revealed missing second pattern'

progress:
  - 'Applied compliance pattern to explore.md first box (Feature Discovery)'
  - 'User tested and discovered second box was missing the pattern'
  - 'Applied compliance pattern to explore.md second box (Conversational Discovery)'
  - 'Updated build-plan.md with progress and key decisions'

decisions:
  - 'Pattern must be applied before EVERY box in a template, not just the first one'
  - 'Need to scan all remaining commands for multiple boxes before applying patterns'
  - 'User prefers to continue without PM tracking for this feature'

blockers:
  - 'None currently - ready to proceed with remaining 9 command files'

nextSteps:
  - 'Scan all 9 remaining command files to count boxes in each'
  - 'Apply compliance pattern before every box found'
  - 'Test the updated explore.md with another fresh session to verify both boxes work'
  - 'Write smoke test to verify template compliance'
  - 'Document the pattern in .hodge/patterns/'
