summary: 'Applied compliance pattern to explore.md, user interrupted before applying to remaining commands'

progress:
  - 'Applied Combined Visual + Textual Emphasis Pattern to .claude/commands/explore.md'
  - 'Pattern includes: warning banner, explicit instructions, character-for-character copying requirement, checklist'
  - 'Identified 10 additional commands that need the pattern (build, checkpoint, codify, decide, harden, hodge, plan, review, ship, status)'

decisions:
  - 'Pattern placement: Immediately after frontmatter, before the formatted box'
  - 'Test-first approach: Apply to /explore first, verify it works, then roll out to all commands'

blockers:
  - 'User interrupted the Edit tool when attempting to apply pattern to build.md'
  - 'Need to determine how user wants to proceed with remaining 10 commands'

nextSteps:
  - 'Clarify with user how to proceed: apply to all 10 commands, or test /explore first?'
  - 'Once approach is clear, apply pattern to remaining commands'
  - 'Write smoke test to verify template compliance'
  - 'Test the pattern with a fresh /explore session'
  - 'Document the pattern in .hodge/patterns/ for future command authoring'
