# Exploration: HODGE-355

**Title**: Review release script bug fixes and update test coverage

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-355
**Type**: general
**Created**: 2025-10-26T18:45:58.535Z

## Problem Statement

The `release:prepare` script was generating bloated CHANGELOG entries due to three issues: (1) including too many commits when no git tags exist (entire repo history), (2) pulling in entire commit message bodies instead of just the subject line, and (3) corrupting the CHANGELOG header by prepending content instead of inserting after it. Three surgical bug fixes were made to address these issues, but they were implemented outside the Hodge workflow and need test coverage to prevent regression.

## Conversation Summary

The exploration identified the root cause: too many commits combined with long commit messages were producing unusable CHANGELOG entries during the release process. Three bug fixes were implemented:

1. **Smart fallback for `getCommitsSince()`**: When no git tags exist, the function now falls back to the last release date in CHANGELOG.md, then to "30 days ago", instead of including the entire repository history.

2. **Multi-paragraph commit message truncation**: The `getCommitsSince()` function now truncates commit messages at the first paragraph break (`\n\n`) or markdown section (`\n#`), preventing entire commit bodies from appearing in CHANGELOG entries.

3. **CHANGELOG header preservation**: The `release-prepare.js` script now inserts new release sections after the "# Changelog" header and preamble, rather than prepending to the entire file which corrupted the header.

During exploration, we discovered that CHANGELOG.md had been corrupted during manual testing (truncated at "and this project adh"). This was restored from git.

The decision was made to add smoke tests to the existing `hodge-354.smoke.test.ts` file rather than creating integration tests, as these bug fixes should be caught quickly during development with fast feedback.

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Add Smoke Tests to Existing Test Suite
**Description**: Extend the existing `hodge-354.smoke.test.ts` file with new test cases for each of the three bug fixes.

**Pros**:
- Fast feedback (<100ms per test) for catching regressions
- Consistent with existing test structure and organization
- Minimal new infrastructure needed
- Tests live alongside related release script tests

**Cons**:
- Requires mocking filesystem and git operations for CHANGELOG date parsing
- May not catch complex integration issues (acceptable for bug fixes)

**When to use**: Ideal for validating bug fixes that should be caught during development with fast, focused tests.

### Approach 2: Create Integration Test Suite
**Description**: Create a new `hodge-354-bugfixes.integration.test.ts` file with tests using real temporary git repositories.

**Pros**:
- More thorough validation with real git operations
- Catches complex edge cases and integration issues
- Better confidence in production behavior

**Cons**:
- Slower test execution (~500ms per test)
- More complex test setup and teardown
- Overkill for simple bug fixes

**When to use**: Better suited for complex features with many integration points, not for focused bug fixes.

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Both Smoke and Integration)
**Description**: Add smoke tests for happy paths and integration tests for edge cases.

**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds: fast feedback + thorough coverage
- Smoke tests catch common regressions, integration tests validate complex scenarios

**Cons**:
- More test code to maintain
- Longer test suite execution time
- Complexity may not be justified for three bug fixes

**When to use**: Appropriate for critical features with both simple and complex behaviors.

## Recommendation

**Use Approach 1: Add Smoke Tests to Existing Test Suite**

These are focused bug fixes to existing utility functions, not new features with complex integration requirements. Smoke tests will provide fast feedback during development and catch regressions quickly. The existing `hodge-354.smoke.test.ts` file already tests the release utility functions, making it the natural home for these additional test cases.

The tests should verify:
1. `getCommitsSince()` fallback logic when no tags exist (CHANGELOG date parsing → "30 days ago" fallback)
2. Commit message truncation at `\n\n` and `\n#` markers
3. CHANGELOG insertion after header (not prepending to entire file)

## Test Intentions

### 1. Smart Fallback Logic for `getCommitsSince()`
**Behavior**: When no git tags exist, the function should fall back to the last release date in CHANGELOG.md, then to "30 days ago" if no CHANGELOG date is found.

**Verification**:
- Mock `getLatestTag()` to return `null` (no tags)
- Mock `readFileSync()` for CHANGELOG.md with a release date
- Verify `getCommitsSince(null)` uses `--since="<CHANGELOG-date>"` format
- Verify fallback to "30 days ago" when CHANGELOG has no release date
- Verify fallback to "30 days ago" when CHANGELOG doesn't exist

### 2. Multi-Paragraph Commit Message Truncation
**Behavior**: Commit messages with paragraph breaks (`\n\n`) or markdown sections (`\n#`) should be truncated to just the first line.

**Verification**:
- Test commit with `\n\n` separator → verify only first paragraph extracted
- Test commit with `\n#` markdown section → verify only text before section extracted
- Test commit with both markers → verify stops at first occurrence
- Test single-line commit → verify no truncation occurs

### 3. CHANGELOG Header Preservation
**Behavior**: New release sections should be inserted after the "# Changelog" header and any following blank lines, not prepended to the entire file.

**Verification**:
- Mock CHANGELOG.md with header + preamble + existing releases
- Verify new section inserted after preamble (not at file start)
- Verify header text "# Changelog" remains intact
- Verify preamble text remains intact
- Verify error thrown if "# Changelog" header not found

## Decisions Decided During Exploration

1. **CHANGELOG.md restoration**: Restored the corrupted CHANGELOG.md file from git (completed during exploration)
2. **Test approach**: Use smoke tests instead of integration tests for faster feedback loops
3. **Test location**: Add tests to existing `hodge-354.smoke.test.ts` file to keep related tests together
4. **Test coverage scope**: Cover all three bug fixes with focused smoke tests

## Decisions Needed

**No Decisions Needed** - All decisions were resolved during exploration.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review exploration findings
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-355` to implement the smoke tests
