# Test Intentions for HODGE-355

## Purpose
Document what we intend to test when this feature moves to build mode.
These are not actual tests, but a checklist of behaviors to verify.

## Core Requirements

- [ ] Should complete within reasonable time (<500ms)
- [ ] Should handle invalid input gracefully
- [ ] Should integrate with existing systems

## General-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Should provide the intended functionality
- [ ] Should integrate with existing code
- [ ] Should handle errors appropriately
- [ ] Should be maintainable and documented

## Approach-Specific Tests
- [ ] Selected implementation approach should work correctly
- [ ] Solution integrates well with existing codebase

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Should work with current authentication system
- [ ] Should respect user permissions
- [ ] Should handle database transactions properly
- [ ] Should emit appropriate events/logs

## Performance Criteria
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for typical operations
- [ ] Memory usage should not increase significantly
