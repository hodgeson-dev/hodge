phase: build
featureId: HODGE-377.5
summary: 'Implemented PM adapter sub-feature methods, 8 smoke tests passing'

progress:
  - 'Extended BasePMAdapter interface with isEpic(), getSubIssues(), getParentIssue()'
  - 'Implemented LocalAdapter sub-feature methods using directory scanning'
  - 'Implemented LinearAdapter sub-feature methods using Linear API'
  - 'Implemented GitHubAdapter sub-feature methods using labels and task lists'
  - 'Created comprehensive smoke test suite (8 tests, all passing)'
  - 'Verified zero TypeScript compilation errors'

decisions:
  - 'Chose adapter-centric design: each adapter owns its sub-feature detection logic'
  - 'Made all sub-feature methods async to accommodate API calls (non-hot-path operations)'
  - 'Implemented graceful degradation: API failures return empty/null with warning logs'
  - 'LocalAdapter uses numeric sorting for sub-features (HODGE-377.10 after HODGE-377.9)'
  - 'GitHubAdapter getParentIssue() returns null (no native parent/child support)'

nextSteps:
  - 'Refactor id-manager.ts to use adapter.isValidIssueID() instead of hardcoded regex'
  - 'Refactor sub-feature-context-service.ts to use adapter.getParentIssue() and adapter.getSubIssues()'
  - 'Refactor local-pm-adapter.ts to remove hardcoded HODGE- patterns from ID generation'
  - 'Refactor lessons.ts to make feature ID extraction adapter-agnostic'
  - 'Run full test suite to verify no regressions'

  conversationHighlights: |
    Built foundation for multi-adapter support by implementing sub-feature detection
    methods across all three PM adapters. Each adapter uses its native mechanism:
    - LocalAdapter: Directory naming convention parsing
    - LinearAdapter: Native Linear API parent/child relationships
    - GitHubAdapter: Epic label and task list parsing

    Foundation complete and tested. Ready for refactoring phase to actually USE
    these methods throughout the codebase (id-manager, sub-feature-context-service, etc).
