phase: ship
featureId: HODGE-359.1
summary: "Discovered ship scope bug - uses 'all' instead of checking since buildStartCommit"

progress:
  - "Fixed 5 failing tests that used deprecated 'success' field (converted to errorCount)"
  - "Fixed prettier error_pattern regex (was matching all lines including success messages)"
  - "Fixed dependency-cruiser YAML file error (excluded .yaml/.json/.md from dependency checks)"
  - "Added debug logging to isToolResultSuccessful to trace validation failures"
  - "All harden quality gates passing (tests, linting, type checking, formatting, architecture, security)"

decisions:
  - 'Prettier error pattern should be ''^\[warn\]\s+\S+\.\S+'' to match only file paths, not success messages'
  - "dependency-cruiser should exclude data files (.yaml, .json, .md) from module resolution"
  - "Both .hodge/toolchain.yaml AND src/bundled-config/tool-registry.yaml need pattern updates (project vs tests)"
  - "Tests use mocked stdout strings, not real tool execution (HODGE-357.1 standard)"

blockers:
  - "Ship command uses scope 'all' which checks entire codebase, not just feature changes"
  - "Ship should check files since buildStartCommit (from ship-record.json), not all files or just uncommitted"
  - "Currently ship fails with prettier errorCount=2 and dependency-cruiser errorCount=7 on unrelated files"

nextSteps:
  - "Fix ship scope: Read buildStartCommit from ship-record.json and validate files changed since that commit"
  - "Add new ToolchainService method: getFilesSinceCommit(commitSha) using git diff <sha>...HEAD"
  - "Update ShipService.runQualityGates() to use commit-based scope instead of 'all'"
  - "Remove debug logging from isToolResultSuccessful after ship works"
  - "Update commit message to include ship scope bug fix"

  conversationHighlights: "User identified critical insight: ship should validate all changes since buildStartCommit (tracked in ship-record.json), not just uncommitted files or entire codebase. This is the root cause of ship validation failures."
