phase: harden
featureId: HODGE-359.1
summary: 'Fixed implementation issues: removed success field, added validation-results.json generation'

progress:
  - 'Discovered and fixed missing validation-results.json generation in review mode'
  - 'Removed quality-checks.md generation (feature goal: replace with validation-results.json)'
  - 'Created isToolResultSuccessful() helper function to replace success field'
  - 'Fixed all 22 TypeScript errors referencing removed success field in production code'
  - 'Fixed 3 ESLint errors in toolchain-service.ts (RegExp.exec instead of String.match)'
  - 'Updated ReviewFindings interface to include rawToolResults'
  - 'Updated ReviewEngineService to pass through raw tool results'
  - 'Added writeValidationResults() method to HardenReview class'

decisions:
  - 'Keep quality-checks.md generation REMOVED (feature explicitly replaces it with validation-results.json)'
  - 'Use helper function isToolResultSuccessful() instead of direct success field checks'
  - 'Success = errorCount === 0, skipped checks count as passing'
  - 'validation-results.json is the source of truth, quality-checks.md is legacy'

blockers:
  - 'Test file (hodge-356.smoke.test.ts) uses success:true in mock data (needs errorCount instead)'
  - 'Need to verify validation-results.json is generated correctly in review mode'

nextSteps:
  - "Re-run 'hodge harden HODGE-359.1 --review' to verify validation-results.json generation"
  - 'Fix test mock data in hodge-356.smoke.test.ts to use errorCount: 0 instead of success: true'
  - 'Verify all quality checks pass'
  - 'Complete harden review workflow'

  implementationIssues: |
    During harden, discovered that build phase implementation was incomplete:
    1. validation-results.json not generated in --review mode
    2. quality-checks.md was being generated (should be removed)
    3. All references to removed 'success' field needed updating
    4. Test mocks still use old success field
  conversationHighlights: |
    User asked why quality-checks.md was being generated when it should be removed.
    Investigation revealed ReviewEngineService runs quality checks but doesn't save
    validation-results.json. Fixed by adding rawToolResults to ReviewFindings and
    creating writeValidationResults() method in HardenReview.
