  "commitMessage": "feat(harden): consolidate critical files into review manifest\n\n## What Changed\n- Enhanced ReviewManifest interface with critical_files section (review-manifest.ts:74)\n- Added buildCriticalFilesSection() method to ReviewManifestGenerator (464 lines)\n- Updated ReviewEngineService to pass critical files data to manifest generator (line 96)\n- Fixed TypeScript error: removed unused changedFiles parameter from displayReviewSummary()\n- Updated /harden template to reference manifest critical_files instead of separate file\n- Added 2 smoke tests for critical_files functionality (lines 289-341)\n- Auto-generated claude-commands.ts synced from slash command updates\n\n## Why This Change\nHODGE-360 eliminates file duplication in the harden workflow by consolidating critical files analysis into the review-manifest.yaml. Previously, the same file metadata appeared in both critical-files.md (top 10 ranked files) and review-manifest.yaml (all changed files), creating redundancy and confusion.\n\nThe consolidated approach provides:\n- Single source of truth for file metadata in review-manifest.yaml\n- Reduced file count from 5 to 3 data files in harden directory\n- Cleaner harden directory with only essential data files\n- Backward compatible (critical_files is optional field)\n\n## Impact\n- Token efficiency: AI reads one manifest instead of multiple files\n- Maintainability: One place to update file prioritization logic\n- User experience: Cleaner harden directory, clearer workflow\n- Development velocity: Reduced cognitive load during code review\n- All 1343 tests passing, zero TypeScript errors\n- Production ready with 2 acceptable warnings (1.13% test duplication, auto-generated file orphan)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
