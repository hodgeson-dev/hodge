  "commitMessage": "feat(architecture): add DOT graph generation for AI codebase awareness\n\n## What Changed\n- Added ArchitectureGraphService for DOT format dependency graph generation (src/lib/architecture-graph-service.ts:169 lines)\n- Extended tool-registry.yaml with graph_command field for all architecture tools\n- Integrated graph generation into ship workflow (generates .hodge/architecture-graph.dot after successful ship)\n- Added graph loading to context command for AI availability during /hodge sessions\n- Enhanced toolchain-generator with codebase_analysis section support\n- Added smoke tests for graph service (7 test cases)\n- Updated TypeScript types to support graph commands in toolchain config\n\nModified files:\n- src/lib/architecture-graph-service.ts (new, 169 lines)\n- src/lib/architecture-graph-service.smoke.test.ts (new, 164 lines)\n- src/bundled-config/tool-registry.yaml (added graph_command entries)\n- src/commands/context.ts (graph loading logic)\n- src/commands/ship.ts (graph generation integration)\n- src/lib/toolchain-generator.ts (codebase_analysis support)\n- src/types/toolchain.ts (new type definitions)\n\n## Why This Change\nClaude Code needs continuous awareness of codebase structure to judge code quality, identify architectural drift, and assess impact of changes. Without visibility into dependency relationships and module structure, AI lacks critical architectural context during code reviews and feature development.\n\nThis feature provides that context by:\n1. Generating module-level dependency graphs in DOT format after successful feature ships\n2. Loading the graph during every /hodge invocation, making it available for all workflow commands\n3. Supporting multiple tech stacks (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.) via extensible tool registry\n\nThe implementation uses dependency-cruiser (already in Hodge's toolchain) for TypeScript/JavaScript, with graceful degradation when tools aren't available or generation fails.\n\n## Impact\n- AI can now detect god modules, circular dependencies, and architectural drift\n- Better code review quality with structural awareness\n- Improved decision-making about when architectural shifts are warranted\n- Non-blocking: graph generation failures don't disrupt workflow\n- Module-level granularity (20-30 nodes) provides digestible architectural overview\n- Foundation for future enhancements (real-time generation, multi-level graphs)\n\nTest Results:\n- All 1358 tests passing\n- 7 new smoke tests for graph generation\n- Zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint errors\n- 17 acceptable warnings (function length, TODOs, 1.07% test duplication)\n- 1 architectural warning (claude-commands.ts orphan - auto-generated file)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
